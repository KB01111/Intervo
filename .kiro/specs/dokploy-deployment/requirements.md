# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a production-ready Docker Compose configuration specifically optimized for deploying Intervo on a Dokploy VPS. The deployment should be secure, scalable, and maintainable while ensuring all services (frontend, backend, RAG API, and MongoDB) work correctly in a production environment with proper networking, persistence, and security configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a production-ready Docker Compose configuration for Dokploy, so that I can deploy Intervo reliably on a VPS with proper security and persistence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker Compose file is deployed on Dokploy THEN all services SHALL start successfully and be accessible
2. WHEN services restart THEN data persistence SHALL be maintained for MongoDB and application files
3. WHEN the application is accessed THEN proper networking between services SHALL be established
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN sensitive data SHALL be properly secured
5. WHEN the deployment runs THEN it SHALL use production-optimized configurations instead of development settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper service isolation and networking, so that the application components can communicate securely while being protected from external access where appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN internal services SHALL only be accessible within the Docker network
2. WHEN external access is needed THEN only the frontend and necessary API endpoints SHALL be exposed
3. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use internal Docker networking with proper service discovery
4. WHEN MongoDB is accessed THEN it SHALL only be accessible from authorized backend services
5. WHEN the RAG API is called THEN it SHALL only be accessible from the backend service

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build processes and resource management, so that the deployment is efficient and doesn't waste VPS resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are built THEN they SHALL use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
2. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL have appropriate resource limits configured
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL use production Node.js settings
4. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be optimized for production delivery
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN only production dependencies SHALL be included

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want proper security configurations, so that the deployment follows security best practices and protects sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MongoDB is configured THEN it SHALL use strong authentication credentials
2. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use secure internal networking
3. WHEN environment variables are used THEN sensitive data SHALL be properly managed
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL not expose unnecessary ports or services
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL not contain sensitive information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want proper health checks and restart policies, so that the application remains available and recovers automatically from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service fails THEN it SHALL automatically restart according to the configured policy
2. WHEN services are starting THEN health checks SHALL verify service readiness
3. WHEN dependencies are not ready THEN dependent services SHALL wait appropriately
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN services SHALL remain responsive
5. WHEN monitoring the deployment THEN service status SHALL be easily observable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want clear documentation and configuration management, so that the deployment can be easily maintained and updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the configuration THEN all settings SHALL be clearly documented
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly specified with examples
3. WHEN deploying THEN step-by-step instructions SHALL be provided
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be documented
5. WHEN updating THEN the process SHALL be clearly defined and safe
